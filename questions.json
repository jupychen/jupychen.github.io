B is tricky. t-SNE does help you visualize multidimensional data but option B refers to input variables, not hyperparameters. For this very tricky question, I would do with D.

To tackle this problem, in 2015, Bahdanau et al. proposed the attention mechanism. In an attention mechanism, the decoder tries to find the location in the encoder sequence where the most important information could be located and uses that information and previously decoded words to predict the next token in the sequence.",
